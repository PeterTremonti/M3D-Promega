M3D Promega with a compound mixing nozzle on a single hot end with dual extruders.

This is my current setup for a used M3D Promega I picked up in non working order.  I have set it up to use the IR sensor for z homing and also for bed mesh setting.  The files also include something for Cura to allow color change from top to bottom or a mix from one color to another in the center and back to the first color since it's a mixing nozzle.
